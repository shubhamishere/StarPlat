# StarPlat
StarPlat, allows programmers to specify graph algorithms in a high-level format, but
generates code for three different backends from the same algorithmic specification. In particular, the DSL compiler generates OpenMP for multi-core systems, MPI for distributed systems,
and CUDA for many - core GPUs.

# Package
## Directories
graphcode: contains generated backend code, custom graph data structures, main caller functions, static and dynamic DSL code, few manually written graph algorithms code for, header files and sample example graphs.
src
py-starplat

## Dependencies
lib-omp, for executing OpenMP code
nvcc, for executing CUDA code
, for MPI code

# Build
make, gcc14, flex, bison for compiling (building) StarPlat itself and other dependencies are needed according to the backend code the user wants to execute

## System requirements
Mac
Linux
WSL

## Steps to build and execute

### Installation and Usage Instruction for linux/WSL

##### Make sure you have build-essential (latest), bison 3.8.2, gcc 11, g++ 11, flex 2.6.4, libomp-dev
 Use the following command in the debian terminal to install all the required tools
 ``` sudo apt install build-essential gcc g++ bison flex libomp-dev ```

### Making the StarPlat src

Get to the src folder of the repository and run the following command in the terminal
``` make ```

### Compiling the DSL Codes
To Compile the dsl codes to generate OMP specific code use the following command in the terminal
```
./StarPlat [-s|-d] -f <dsl.sp> -b [cuda|omp|mpi|acc|sycl]

#Example
./StarPlat -s -f ../graphcode/staticDSLCodes/triangle_counting_dsl -b omp

-s for static and -d for dynamic
-b select the type of backend
-f the dsl file to input
```
>Once the omp code is generated it would be reflected in generated_omp folder of the graphcode directory in the repository

### Running the OMP code

In the graphcode folder there is a main.cpp file, edit out the dsl file name in the header and modify path for the loading different graphs and then compile and run using g++.
```  
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16
g++ main.cpp -o main -fopenmp 
./main
```
